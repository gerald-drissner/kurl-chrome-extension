# Privacy Policy for kurl - YOURLS Shortener

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-25

This Privacy Policy describes how the "kurl - YOURLS Shortener" browser extension handles your information.

## No Data Collection by the Developer

This extension is designed with privacy as a priority. We, the developers, do not collect, store, transmit, or have access to any of your personal information or browsing data.

## Information Handled by the Extension

The extension handles two types of information, both of which remain under your control:

1.  **Configuration Data:** To function, the extension requires you to provide your self-hosted YOURLS instance URL and your private API signature token. This information is stored locally on your computer using the browser's standard storage API (`browser.storage.local`). This data is never sent to the developer or any third-party servers. It is used solely to send API requests from your browser to your own YOURLS server.

2.  **URL Data:** The core purpose of the extension is to shorten URLs. To do this, it processes the URL of the webpage you are currently viewing when you activate the extension. This URL is sent directly to your configured YOURLS server for shortening and is not collected or viewed by the developer.

## Data Usage

All data handled by this extension is used exclusively for its core functionalityâ€”shortening URLs via your own YOURLS instance.
