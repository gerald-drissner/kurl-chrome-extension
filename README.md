## About YOURLS (Your Own URL Shortener)

YOURLS is a free, open-source set of PHP scripts that allows you to run your own URL shortening service. Unlike commercial services, YOURLS gives you full control over your data, with powerful features like detailed statistics, link management, and a plugin architecture to extend its functionality.

This extension requires you to have your own YOURLS instance already installed and running on a web server.

### How to Install YOURLS

Self-hosting YOURLS requires a web server with PHP and a MySQL database. For complete and detailed instructions, please refer to the official guide:
**[Official YOURLS Installation Guide](https://yourls.org/#Install)**

### Finding Your API Signature Token

To connect this extension to your YOURLS instance, you need your unique API signature token.

1.  Log in to your YOURLS admin dashboard (e.g., `http://your-domain.com/admin/`).
2.  In the top menu, click on **Tools**.
3.  Your API signature token is the long string of characters displayed in the **"Secure passwordless API call"** section at the top of the page.
